## Learning objectives

-   Summarize a categorical variables.
-   Display a categorical variable with a simple plot.
-   Summarize numerical variables.
-   Dispaly numerical variables with histograms and box plots.

In this Lab, we will use the data from `arrhythmia` dataset that we have already downloaded in our PC. (**Note:** This starts by assuming we know how to get data into Jamovi).


## Summarizing Categorical Data (Frequency Statistics for one categorical variable)

Consider the binary `sex` variable in arrhythmia dataset. A simple way for summarizing the data is to create a table that shows the number of times each category has been observed.

Firstly, we add labels to numerically coded values of `sex` variable (see @sec-lab1) (0 = male, 1 = female).

Then we select:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A(Analyses) -.-> B(Exploration) -.-> C(Descriptives)
```

from the top menu, as shown below in @fig-descriptives1.

![In the Analyses Tab select Exploration and click on Descriptives](images/descriptives1.png){#fig-descriptives1}

The `Descriptives` dialogue box opens, as shown below @fig-descriptives2:

![The Descriptives dialogue box](images/descriptives2.png){#fig-descriptives2 width="500" height="442"}

Transfer the `sex` variable from the box on the left side of the screen into the `Variables` box on the right side by highlighting the variable and pressing the Arrow Button (alternatively, drag and drop the variable `sex`). We will end up with the following screen:

![Transfer the `sex` variable into the `Variables` box](images/descriptives3.png){#fig-descriptives3 width="500" height="442"}

Finally, we check the `Frequency tables` box and we also unchecked all the other options for descriptive statistics as shown below:

![Check the `Frequency tables` box and unchecked all the other options for descriptive statistics](images/descriptives4.png){#fig-descriptives4}

The output should look like the following:

![The output of frequency distribution of sex](images/descriptives5.png){#fig-descriptives5}

The percentage of female patients (55%, 249/452) is larger than the percentage of male patients (45%, 203/452) in our data.

To generate a basic descriptive plot navigate to the `Plot` section and check the `Bar Plot`, as shown below:

![From the Plot section check the `Bar Plot`](images/descriptives6.png){#fig-descriptives6}

The Bar Plot produced here presents the absolute frequencies (counts).

More descriptive plots are available for all data types using the `surveymv` and `JJStatsPlot` modules.

## Summarizing Numerical Data

Navigate to:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A(Analyses) -.-> B(Exploration) -.-> C(Descriptives)
```

Now, select the variables `age` and `QRS` and drag them in the empty `Variables` box, as shown below:

![select the variables `age` and `QRS`](images/descriptives8.png){#fig-descriptives8}

Next, we decide how to display our data tables. We have got the following two options:

-   Variables across columns

-   Variables across rows

Let' select variable across columns (the default).

We can now select the relevant descriptive statistics in the `Statistics` section:

![select the descriptive statistics of interest](images/descriptives9.png){#fig-descriptives9}

Once we have selected our descriptive statistics, a table will appear in the output window on our right, as shown below:

![Descriptive statistics of interest for `age` and `QRS` variables](images/descriptives10.png){#fig-descriptives10}

For continuous data we can select Histograms, Box Plots, Violin and Data as shown below:

![Select Histograms, Box Plots, and Violin plots.](images/descriptives11.png){#fig-descriptives11}

![Histograms of age](images/hist1.png){#fig-hist1}

![Violin plot of age](images/violin1.png){#fig-violin1}

Age is a symmetrical distribution.

![Histograms of QRS](images/hist2.png){#fig-hist2}

![Violin plot of QRS](images/violin2.png){#fig-violin2}

QRS is an asymmetrical distribution (the data are skewed to the right).
