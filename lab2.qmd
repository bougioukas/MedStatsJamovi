When we have finished this Lab, we should be able to:

## Learning objectives

-   Navigate Jamovi, import files and transform the data.
-   Filter data.
-   Compute new variables based on other variables in our data.
-   Transform existing variables.

In this Lab, we will use the data from `arrhythmia` dataset that we have already downloaded in our PC.




## Summarizing Categorical Data (Frequency Statistics for one categorical variable)

Consider the binary `sex` variable in arrhythmia dataset. A simple way for summarizing the data is to create a table that shows the number of times each category has been observed.

Firstly, we add labels to numerically coded values of `sex` variable (see @sec-lab1) (0 = male, 1 = female). 

Then we select:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A(Analyses) -.-> B(Exploration) -.-> C(Descriptives)
```

from the top menu, as shown below in @fig-descriptives1.

![In the Analyses Tab select Exploration and click on Descriptives](images/descriptives1.png){#fig-descriptives1}

The `Descriptives` dialogue box opens, as shown below:

![The Descriptives dialogue box](images/descriptives2.png){#fig-descriptives2 width="500" height="442"}


Transfer the `sex` variable from the box on the left side of the screen into the `Variables` box on the right side by highlighting the variable and pressing the Arrow Button (alternatively, drag and drop the variable `sex`). We will end up with the following screen:

Finally, tick the `Frequency tables` as shown below:
