-   Summarize a categorical variables.
-   Display a categorical variable with a simple plot.
-   Summarize numerical variables.

In this Lab, we will use the data from `arrhythmia` dataset that we have already downloaded in our PC. (**Note:** This starts by assuming we know how to get data into Jamovi).

## Summarizing Categorical Data (Frequency Statistics for one categorical variable)

Consider the binary `sex` variable in arrhythmia dataset. A simple way for summarizing the data is to create a table that shows the number of times each category has been observed.

Firstly, we add labels to numerically coded values of `sex` variable (see @sec-lab1) (0 = male, 1 = female).

On the Jamovi top menu navigate to

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A(Analyses) -.-> B(Exploration) -.-> C(Descriptives)
```

as shown below in @fig-descriptives1.

![In the menu at the top, choose Analyses \> Exploration ![](images/explor_icon.png){width="35" height="33"} \> Descriptives.](images/descriptives1.png){#fig-descriptives1 width="85%"}

The *Descriptives* dialogue box opens, as shown below @fig-descriptives2:

![The Descriptives dialogue box.](images/descriptives2.png){#fig-descriptives2 width="75%"}

Transfer the `sex` variable from the left-hand pane into the *Variables* pane by highlighting the variable and pressing the **Arrow** Button (![](images/right_arrow.png){width="23" height="21"}). Alternatively, drag and drop the variable. Next, we tick the "**Frequency tables**" box and we also uncheck all the other options of descriptive statistics. We will end up with the following screen (@fig-descriptives4):

![Drag and drop the **sex** variable to Variables pane](images/descriptives4.png){#fig-descriptives4 width="75%"}

The output should look like the following:

![Frequency distribution table of **sex**](images/descriptives5.png){#fig-descriptives5 width="55%"}

The percentage of female patients (55%, 249/452) is larger than the percentage of male patients (45%, 203/452) in our data.

To generate a basic descriptive plot navigate to the *Plots* section and check the **Bar Plot**, as shown below (@fig-descriptives6):

![From the Plots section check the Bar plot](images/descriptives6.png){#fig-descriptives6 width="75%"}

The bar plot produced here presents the absolute frequencies (counts) (@fig-descriptives7).

![The bar plot produced by Jamovi for the binary variable **sex**](images/descriptives7.png){#fig-descriptives7 width=50%}

More descriptive plots are available for all data types using the `surveymv` and `JJStatsPlot` modules.

## Summarizing Numerical Data

From the top menu navigate to:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A(Analyses) -.-> B(Exploration) -.-> C(Descriptives)
```

as shown in @fig-descriptives1.

Now, drag and drop the variables `age` and `QRS` into the empty *Variables* box, as shown below (@fig-descriptives8):

![Drag and drop the age and QRS to Variables pane.](images/descriptives8.png){#fig-descriptives8 width="75%"}

Next, we decide how to display our data tables. We have got the following two options:

-   Variables across columns

-   Variables across rows

Let' select variable across columns (the default).

We can now select the relevant descriptive statistics in the *Statistics* section:

![Select the descriptive statistics of interest.](images/descriptives9.png){#fig-descriptives9 width="75%"}

Once we have selected our descriptive statistics, a table will appear in the output window on our right, as shown below (@fig-descriptives10):

![Descriptive statistics for variables **age** and **QRS**](images/descriptives10.png){#fig-descriptives10 width=45%}

For continuous data we can select Histograms, Box Plots, Violin and Data as shown below:

![From the Plots section select Histograms, Box Plots, and Violin plots.](images/descriptives11.png){#fig-descriptives11 width="75%"}

![Histograms of age](images/hist1.png){#fig-hist1 width=55%}

![Violin plot of age](images/violin1.png){#fig-violin1 width=55%}

Age is a symmetrical distribution.

![Histograms of QRS](images/hist2.png){#fig-hist2 width=55%}

![Violin plot of QRS](images/violin2.png){#fig-violin2 width=55%}

QRS is an asymmetrical distribution (the data are skewed to the right).
