## Introduction

The one-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) or the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test are used to detect whether there are any differences between more than two independent (unrelated) samples.

Althought, these tests can detect a difference between several groups they do not inform about which groups are different from the others. At first sight we might clarify the question by comparing all groups in pairs with t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests. However, that procedure may lead us to the wrong conclusions (known as multiple comparisons problem).

Why is this procedure inappropriate? Quite simply, because we would be wrongly testing the null hypothesis. Each comparison one conducts increases the likelihood of committing at least one Type I error within a set of comparisons (famillywise Type I error rate).

This is the reason why, after an ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test concluding on a difference between groups, we should not just compare all possible pairs of groups with t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests. Instead we perform statistical tests that take into account the number of comparisons (post hoc tests). Some of the more commonly used ones are Tukey test, Games-Howell test, and Bonferroni correction.

## One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

One-way analysis of variance, usually referred to as one-way ANOVA, is a statistical test used when we want to compare several means. We may think of it as an extension of Student's t-test to the case of more than two samples.

### Opening the file

Open the dataset named "dataDWL" from the file tab in the menu:

![The dataDWL dataset](images/dataDWL.png){#fig-dataDWL width="85%"}

The dataset "dataDWL" has 60 participants and includes two variables (@fig-dataDWL). The numeric `WeightLoss` variable and the `Diet` variable (with levels `A`, `B`, `C` and `D`).

### Research question

Consider the example of the variations between weight loss according to four different types of diet (`A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`). The question that may be asked is: does the average weight loss (units in kg) differ according to the diet?

### Hypothesis Testsing for the ANOVA test

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis

-   $H_0$: all group means are equal (the means of weight loss in the four diets are equal: $\mu_{A} = \mu_{B} = \mu_{C} = \mu_{D}$)
-   $H_1$: at least one group mean differs from the others (there is at least one diet with mean weight loss different from the others)
:::

### Assumptions

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Check if the following assumptions are satisfied

1.  The dependent variable, `WeightLoss`, should be approximately **normally** distributed for all groups
2.  The data in groups have similar **variance** (also named as homogeneity of variance or homoscedasticity)
:::

**A. Explore the descriptive characteristics of distribution for each group and check for normality**

The distributions can be explored visually with appropriate plots. Additionally, summary statistics and significance tests to check for normality (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk test) and for equality of variances (e.g., Levene's test) can be used.

On the Jamovi top menu navigate to

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A(Analyses) -.-> B(Exploration) -.-> C(Descriptives)
```

as shown below in @fig-diet0.


![In the menu at the top, choose Analyses \> Exploration ![](images/explor_icon.png){width="35" height="33"} \> Descriptives.](images/diet0.png){#fig-diet0 width="75%"}


The *Descriptives dialogue box* opens. Drag the variable `WeightLoss` into the *Variables* field and *split* it by the `Diet` variable. Additionally, select **Variable across rows**, as shown below (@fig-diet1):

![Split the variable **WeightLoss** by **Diet** group and select Variables across rows.](images/diet1.png){#fig-diet1 width="75%"}

We can now select the relevant descriptive statistics such as **Percantiles**, **Skewness**, **Kurtosis** and the **Shapiro-Wilk** test from the *Statistics* section (@fig-descriptives13):

![In the Statistics section select the descriptive statistics of interest.](images/descriptives13.png){#fig-descriptives13 width="70%"}

Once we have selected our descriptive statistics, a table will appear in the output window on our right-hand side, as shown below (@fig-diet2):

![Descriptive statistics of **WeightLoss** by **Diet** group (click on figure to zoom in).](images/diet2.png){#fig-diet2}

The means are close to medians and the standard deviations are also similar indicating normal distributions for all groups. Additionally, both shape measures, skewness and (excess) kurtosis, have values in the acceptable range \[-1, 1\] which indicate symmetric and mesokurtic distributions, respectively.

The Shapiro-Wilk tests of normality suggest that the data for the `WeightLoss` in all groups are normally distributed (p \> 0.05 $\Rightarrow H_0$ is not rejected).

::: callout-important
# Remember: Hypothesis testing for Shapiro-Wilk test for normality

$H_{0}$: the data came from a normally distributed population.

$H_{1}$: the data tested are not normally distributed.

-   If p − value \< 0.05, reject the null hypothesis, $H_{0}$.
-   If p − value ≥ 0.05, do not reject the null hypothesis, $H_{0}$.
:::

Then we can check the **Density** box from *Histograms* in the *Plot* section, as shown below (@fig-plots_density):

![In the Plots section select Density from Histograms.](images/plots_density.png){#fig-plots_density width="75%"}

A graph (@fig-diet3) is generated in the output window on our right-hand side:

![The Density plot of **WeightLoss** for each **Diet**.](images/diet3.png){#fig-diet3 width="70%"}

The above density plots show that the data are close to symmetry and the assumption of a normal distribution is reasonable for all diet groups.

**B. Homogeneity of variance**

The second assumption that should be satisfied is the homogeneity of variance. We observe in the summary table of @fig-diet2 that the standard deviations are similar (see also below the Levene's test for equality of variances in @fig-t_test4).

 

### Run the ANOVA test

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
# Perform ANOVA in Jamovi

We will perform ANOVA to test the null hypothesis that the mean `WeightLoss` is the same for all `Diet` groups.

On the Jamovi top menu navigate to

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A(Analyses) -.-> B(ANOVA) -.-> C(One-Way ANOVA)
```

as shown below in @fig-diet4.

![Conducting ANOVA test in Jamovi. In the menu at the top, choose Analyses \> ANOVA ![](images/anova_icon.png){width="35" height="33"} \> One-Way ANOVA.](images/diet4.png){#fig-diet4 width="75%"}

The *One-Way ANOVA dialogue box* opens. Drag and drop the `WeightLoss` to Dependent Variables field and the `Diet` to Grouping Variable, as shown below @fig-diet5:

![One-Way ANOVA dialogue box. Drag the **WeightLoss** into the Dependent Variables field and the **Diet** into the Grouping Variable field.](images/diet5.png){#fig-diet5 width="75%"}

We observe that we can select between the following two Tests: Welch's test (the default), or Fisher's test. At the moment, we keep the default choice. Moreover, from **Additional Statistics** check the **Descriptive** and **Descriptive plots** boxes. Finally, from **Assumption Checks** tick the **Homogeneity test** box. We will end up with the following screen:

![Additional statistics and tests.](images/diet6.png){#fig-diet6 width="75%"}
:::


First, we look at the table of **Levene's test** for equality of variances (@fig-diet7):

![Levene's test.](images/diet7.png){#fig-diet7 width="60%"}

::: callout-important
# Remember: Hypothesis testing for Levene's test for equality of variances

$H_{0}$: the variances of `WeightLoss` in all groups are equal ($σ^2_A=σ^2_B=σ^2_C=σ^2_D$)

$H_{1}$: the variances of `WeightLoss` differ between groups ($σ^2_i\neq σ^2_j$, where $i,j= A, B, C, D$ and $i\neq j$)

-   If p − value \< 0.05, reject the null hypothesis, $H_{0}$.
-   If p − value ≥ 0.05, do not reject the null hypothesis, $H_{0}$.
:::

Since p = 0.583 \> 0.05, the $H_0$ of the Levene's test is not rejected and we have to perform the **Fisher's test** which assumes equal variances (@fig-diet8). So, let's tick on the **Assume equal (Fisher's)** box. (NOTE: If the $p \geq 0.05$, then the population variances of `WeightLoss` in all groups are assumed equal).

![Fisher's ANOVA test.](images/diet8.png){#fig-diet8 width="75%"}

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
## ANOVA test (Welch's option)

If the assumption of equal variances is not satisfied (Levene's test gives p \< 0.05, reject $H_0$), the Welch's option of ANOVA should be used from the available Tests in Jamovi (@fig-diet8).

:::


Next, we can inspect again the results in the group descriptives table (@fig-diet9) and pertinent plots (@fig-diet9):

![Group descriptive statistics.](images/diet9.png){#fig-diet9 width="65%"}

![Plot of mean (95% CI) of WeightLoss by Diet.](images/diet10.png){#fig-diet10 width="55%"}

From the @fig-diet10 we observe that the participants following the diet C have on average the higher weight loss. 


Finally, we present the results of the Fisher's ANOVA test in the table of @fig-diet11:

![The results of the Fisher's ANOVA test.](images/diet11.png){#fig-diet11 width="55%"}

In @fig-diet11, F= 6.12 indicates the F-statistic:

$$F= \frac{variation \ between \ sample \ means}{variation \ within \ the \ samples}$$ 

Note that we compare this value to an F-distribution (F-test). The degrees of freedom in the numerator (df1) and the denominator (df2) are 3 and 56, respectively.

The p-value=0.001 is less than 0.05 (reject $H_0$ of the ANOVA test). **There is at least one diet with mean weight loss which is different from the other means**.

 

### Run post-hoc tests

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
# Perform post-hoc tests

A **significant** one-way ANOVA is generally followed by post-hoc tests to perform multiple pairwise comparisons between groups. From the *One-Way ANOVA dialogue box* click on *Post-Hoc Tests* section. We have got the following two options:

-   Games-Howell (unequal variances)

-   Tukey (equal variances)

Based on the result of Levene's test (p = 0.583 \> 0.05, the $H_0$ is not rejected) (@fig-diet7), we should select the **Tukey (equal variances)** post-hoc test. Additionally, check the **Flag significant comparisons** as shown below (@fig-diet12):

![Select the appropriate post-hoc test. For equal variances the Tukey post hoc test.](images/diet12.png){#fig-diet12 width="70%"}

Once we have selected our post-hoc test, a table will appear in the output window on our right-hand side, as shown below (@fig-diet13):

![Table with the results of the Tukey post-hoc test.](images/diet13.png){#fig-diet13 width="70%"}

**Interpretation**

Pairwise comparisons were carried out using the method of Tukey and the adjusted p-values were calculated. **The weight loss following diet C is significantly larger compared to diet A (mean difference = 2.93 kg, p=0.005 \<0.05) or diet B (mean difference = 3.21 kg, p=0.002 \<0.05)**.

## Kruskal-Wallis test

The Kruskal-Wallis test is a rank-based non-parametric alternative to the one-way ANOVA and an extension of the Mann-Whitney U test to allow the comparison of more than two independent groups. It's usually recommended when the normality assumption of one-way ANOVA test is not met (non-normal distributions).

### Opening the file

Open the dataset named "dataVO2" from the file tab in the menu:

![The dataVO2 dataset](images/dataVO2.png){#fig-dataVO2 width="85%"}

The dataset "dataVO2" includes 30 participants and has two variables. The numeric `VO2max` variable and the `sport` variable (with levels `rowers`, `runners`, and `triathletes`).

### Research question

We want to compare the VO2max in three different sports (runners, rowers, and triathletes).

### Hypothesis Testsing for the Kruskal-Wallis test

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis

-   $H_0$: the distribution of $VO2_{max}$ is the same in all groups (the medians of $VO2_{max}$ in the three sports are the same)

-   $H_1$: there is at least one group with $VO2_{max}$ distribution different from the others (there is at least one sport with median $VO2_{max}$ different from the others)
:::

**Explore the descriptive characteristics of distribution for each group and check for normality**

The distributions can be explored visually with appropriate plots. Additionally, summary statistics and significance tests to check for normality (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk test).

On the Jamovi top menu navigate to

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A(Analyses) -.-> B(Exploration) -.-> C(Descriptives)
```

as shown below in @fig-athletes0.

![In the menu at the top, choose Analyses \> Exploration ![](images/explor_icon.png){width="35" height="33"} \> Descriptives.](images/athletes0.png){#fig-athletes0 width="75%"}

The *Descriptives dialogue box* opens. Drag the variable `VO2max` into the `Variables` field and split it by the `VO2max` variable. Additionally, select **Variable across rows**, as shown below (@fig-athletes1):

![The Descriptives dialogue box. Split the variable VO2max by sport group and select Variable across rows.](images/athletes1.png){#fig-athletes1 width="75%"}

We can now select the relevant descriptive statistics such as **Percantiles**, **Skewness**, **Kurtosis** and the **Shapiro-Wilk** test from the *Statistics* section (@fig-descriptives13):

![Select the descriptive statistics of interest from the Statistics section.](images/descriptives13.png){width="70%"}

Once we have selected our descriptive statistics, a table will appear in the output window on our right-hand side, as shown below (@fig-athletes2):

![Descriptive statistics of VO2max by sport group (click on the image to zoom in).](images/athletes2.png){#fig-athletes2}

The sample size is relative small. Moreover, the skewness=1.51 and the kurtosis=1.6 for the triathletes are out of the range of -1 and 1 indicating non-normal distribution. We can also see that the data for the triathletes is not normally distributed (p=0.023 \<0.05) according to the Shapiro-Wilk test.

Next, in the *Plots* section we can visualize the distribution of `VO2max` for the three groups. From **Box Plots** choices tick the boxes of **Box Plot**, **Violin**, **Data** and **Mean**, as shown below (@fig-athletes3):

![In the Plot section tick the boxes of Box Plots.](images/athletes3.png){#fig-athletes3 width="75%"}

A graph (@fig-athletes4) is generated in the output window on our right-hand side:

![Box-violin plot graph.](images/athletes4.png){#fig-athletes4 width="70%"}

The above figure shows that the data in triathletes group have some outliers. Additionally, we can observe that the runners group seems to have the largest VO2max.

By considering all of the information together (small samples, graphs, normality test) the overall decision is against of normality.

 

### Run the Kruskal-Wallis test

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
# Perform Kruskal-Wallis test in Jamovi

We will perform Kruskal-Wallis test to decide about the null hypothesis that the median $VO2_{max}$ is the same for all sports.

On the Jamovi top menu navigate to

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A(Analyses) -.-> B(ANOVA) -.-> C(Non-Parametric \nOne-Way ANOVA  \nKruskal-Wallis)
```

as shown below in @fig-athletes5.

![Conducting Kruskal-Wallis test in Jamovi. In the menu at the top, choose Analyses \> ANOVA ![](images/anova_icon.png){width="35" height="33"} \> One-Way ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis.](images/athletes5.png){#fig-athletes5 width="75%"}

The *One-Way ANOVA (Non-parametric) dialogue box* opens. Drag and drop the numeric variable `VO2max` to Dependent Variables and the independent variable `sport` to Grouping Variable, as shown below @fig-athletes6:

![One-Way ANOVA (Non-parametric) dialogue box. Drag and drop the VO2max into Dependent Variables and the sport into Grouping Variable. ](images/athletes6.png){#fig-athletes6 width="75%"}

:::


The results of the Kruskal-Wallis test are presented in the table of the @fig-athletes7:

![The results of the Kruskal-Wallis test.](images/athletes7.png){#fig-athletes7 width="45%"}

The p-value (\<0.001) is lower than 0.05. **There is at least one sport in which the VO2max is different from the others**.

 

### Run post-hoc tests

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
# Perform post-hoc tests

A **significant** Kruskal-Wallis test is generally followed by post-hoc tests to perform multiple pairwise comparisons between groups. Jamovi provides a pertinent test named `DSCF pairwise comparisons`:

![Check the DSCF post-hoc test.](images/athletes8.png){#fig-athletes8 width="70%"}

A table appears in the output window on our right-hand side, as shown below (@fig-athletes9):

![Table with the results of the post-hoc tests.](images/athletes9.png){#fig-athletes9 width="65%"}

**Interpretation**

Pairwise comparisons were carried out using the method of Dwas-Steel-Critchlow-Flinger and adjusting p-values were calculated. The runners' VO2max (median= 77.2, IQR=\[74.2, 79.5\] mL/kg/min) seems to be significantly higher than rowers (69.6 \[67.8, 73.1\] mL/kg/min) (p=0.005 \<0.05) and triathletes (65.4 \[64.0, 67.6\] mL/kg/min) (p=0.003 \<0.05).
