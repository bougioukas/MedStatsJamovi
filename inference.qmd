## Hypothesis Testsing

Hypothesis testing is a method of deciding whether the data are consistent with the null hypothesis. The calculation of the p-value is an important part of the procedure. Given a study with a single outcome measure and a statistical test, hypothesis testing can be summarized in five steps.

::: {.callout-tip icon="false"}
## Steps of Hypothesis Testsing

**Step 1:** 
State the null hypothesis, $H_{0}$, and alternative hypothesis, $H_{1}$, based on the research question. 

>NOTE: We decide a non-directional $H_{1}$ (also known as two-sided hypothesis) whether we test for effects in both directions (most common), otherwise a directional (also known as one-sided) hypothesis.

**Step 2:** Set the level of significance, α (usually 0.05).

**Step 3:** Identify the appropriate test statistic and check the assumptions. Calculate the test statistic using the data.

**Step 4:** Decide whether or not the result is statistically significant.

>Based on the outcome of our statistical test, we will have to decide whether to reject or fail to reject our null hypothesis. In most cases we will use the p-value generated by our statistical test to guide our decision. The p-value is the **probability of obtaining the observed results, or something more extreme, if the null hypothesis is true**.

>If the p-value is less  than the significance level ($p < 0.05$), then we reject the null hypothesis.

>If the p-value is greater than or equal to the significance level ($p \geq 0.05$), then we fail to reject the null hypothesis.


The @tbl-p demonstrates how to interpret the strength of the evidence. However, always keep in mind the size of the study being considered.

| p-value              | Interpretation                        |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| $p \geq{0.10}$       | No evidence to reject $H_{0}$         |
| $0.05\leq p < 0.10$  | Weak evidence to reject $H_{0}$       |
| $0.01\leq p < 0.05$  | Evidence to reject   $H_{0}$          |
| $0.001\leq p < 0.01$ | Strong evidence to reject  $H_{0}$    |
| $p < 0.001$          | Very strong evidence to reject $H_{0}$|

**Step 5:** Interpret the results.

Let us discuss this procedure with an example.

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Example

Suppose the mean heart rate in healthy adults is 68 beats per min with standard deviation 8 beats per min (bpm). Research was conducted to examine the pulse rate in patients with hyperthyroidism. Twenty patients were randomly enrolled with a mean of 82 and a standard deviation 11 bpm. Assuming that the heart rate follows a normal distribution, is the mean heart rate in hyperthyroidism patients different from that in healthy adults?
:::

This type of question can be formulated in a hypothesis testing framework by specifying two hypotheses: a null and an alternative hypothesis.

**1. State the null and alternative hypotheses**

The **null hypothesis**, denoted by $H_{0}$, is the hypothesis that is to be tested. It is a statement indicating that there is **no difference or association** between conditions, groups, or variables.

The **alternative hypothesis**, denoted by $H_{1}$, is the hypothesis that, in some sense, contradicts the null hypothesis. The $H_{1}$ hypothesis (also called a research hypothesis) is the statement that **supports** a difference or association between conditions, groups, or variables.

In our example, the null hypothesis $H_{0}$ is that the mean heart rate in hyperthyroidism patients **μ** is the same as the mean heart rate in healthy adults $μ_{0}$. Here $μ_{0}$ is known and μ is unknown; the alternative hypothesis $H_{1}$ is that the mean heart rate in hyperthyroidism patients μ is not the same as the mean heart rate in healthy adults $μ_{0}$. Note that $H_{1}$ may have multiple options (more than, less than, or not the same as).

-   $H_{0}$ : μ=$μ_{0}$, $H_{1}$ : μ\>$μ_{0}$ (one-sided hypothesis; right-tailed)
-   $H_{0}$ : μ=$μ_{0}$, $H_{1}$ : μ\<$μ_{0}$ (one-sided hypothesis; left-tailed)
-   $H_{0}$ : μ=$μ_{0}$, $H_{1}$ : μ $\neq$ $μ_{0}$ (two-sided hypothesis)

In our example, we state the two-sided hypothesis, i.e., assume that the mean heart rate in hyperthyroidism patients may deviate from 68 in either direction. That is:

-   $H_{0}$ : μ=68, $H_{1}$ : μ $\neq$ 68

Thus, we have generated two mutually exclusive and all-inclusive possibilities. Either $H_{0}$ or $H_{1}$ will be true, but not both. So is our decision when we compare the probabilities of obtaining the sample data under each of these hypotheses. In practice, the testing procedure usually starts with $H_{0}$, and when it is completed, the hypothesis testing will suggest either the rejection or non-rejection of $H_{0}$, indirectly also determining $H_{1}$.

**Step 2: Set the level of significance, α**

After stating the hypotheses, a significance level, denoted as α, is specified. It is defined as the probability of making a mistake --- rejecting $H_{0}$ when $H_{0}$ is true (i.e., Type I error). The selection of α is arbitrary although in practice, values of 0.01, 0.05, or 0.10 are commonly used. Because the significance level α reflects the probability of rejecting a true $H_{0}$, therefore this probability is deliberately selected.

In our example, we set the value α=0.05 for the level of significance (type I error).

**Step 3: Identify the appropriate test statistic and check the assumptions. Calculate the test statistic using the data.**

The **one-sample z-test** is used when we want to know whether the difference between the sample mean and the mean of a population is large enough to be statistically significant, that is, if it is unlikely to have occurred by chance. The test is considered robust for violations of normal distribution and it is usually applied to relatively large samples (N \> 30) or when the population variance is known.

**Main assumption:** The test statistic follows the Normal distribution.

**Calculation of the test statistic:** $$z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_{o}}{SE_{z}}= \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_{o}}{\sigma/ \sqrt{n}}=\frac{82 - 68}{8/ \sqrt{20}}=\frac{14}{8/ 4.472}=7.826$$

**Step 4: Decide whether or not the result is statistically significant.**

We can calculate the p-value using a statistical program such as Jamovi. In our example, the p-value is \<0.001 (so less than α=0.05) and $H_{0}$ is rejected. We can also estimate the 95%CI of mean as following:

$$ 95\%CI= \bar{x} \ \pm 1.96  \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}= 82 \ \pm 1.96  \frac{8}{\sqrt{20}}= 82 \ \pm \frac{15.68}{4.472} = 82 \ \pm 3.506 = [78.49, 85.51]$$

Note that, in this case, the value of null hypothesis, 68, is not included in the range of values of the 95%CI.

**Step 5: Interpret the results.**

The mean heart rate (82 bpm) in hyperthyroidism patients is significantly higher than the heart rate in healthy adults (68 bpm).

## Type of Errors and Power of the test

**A. Types of error in hypothesis testing**

**Type I error:** we reject the null hypothesis when it is true (false positive), and conclude that there is an effect when, in reality, there is none. The maximum chance (probability) of making a Type I error is denoted by α (alpha). This is the significance level of the test; we reject the null hypothesis if our p-value is less than the significance level, i.e. if p \< a (@fig-type_errors).

**Type II error:** we do not reject the null hypothesis when it is false (false negative), and conclude that there is no effect when one really exists. The chance of making a Type II error is denoted by β (beta); its compliment, (1 - β), is the power of the test. The power, therefore, is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false; i.e. it is the chance (usually expressed as a percentage) of detecting, as statistically significant, a real treatment effect of a given size (@fig-type_errors).
