The goal of this lab is to introduce you to Jamovi, which we'll be using throughout the course both to learn the statistical concepts discussed in the course and to analyze real data and come to informed conclusions.

## Why Jamovi?

Jamovi is a new fee open "3rd generation" statistical software that is built on top of the programming language R (@fig-jamovi_0). Designed from the ground up to be easy to use, Jamovi is a compelling alternative to costly statistical products such as SPSS and SAS.

## **Some other advantages are:**

1.  Point-and-click environment
2.  It provides informative tables and neat visuals
3.  Enables integration with R
4.  Gives access to a user guide and community resources from the Jamovi website

## Downloading and installing Jamovi

**Jamovi** is available for Windows (64-bit), macOS, Linux and ChromeOS. Installation on desktop is quite straight-forward. Just go to the Jamovi download page <https://www.jamovi.org/download.html>, and download the latest version (current release) for your operating system.

## Navigating Jamovi

When jamovi first opens, we will see a screen something like in @fig-jamovi1.

```{r}
#| label: fig-jamovi1
#| fig-align: left
#| out-width: "95%"
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: Jamovi starts up!.

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "jamovi1.png"))
```

To the left is the spreadsheet view, and to the right is where the results of statistical tests appear. Down the middle is a bar separating these two regions, and this can be dragged to the left or the right to change their sizes.

Â 

Let's take a quick look at the Jamovi Main Menu, referred to hereafter as the **Menu**, as shown in @fig-menu1. This Menu is displayed at the very top of the Jamovi screen:

```{r}
#| label: fig-menu1
#| fig-align: left
#| out-width: "95%"
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: The menu bar provides access to all functions of the program.

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "menu1.png"))
```

There are six tabs in the Menu (from left to right): **File** (a layer with three horizontal levels $\equiv$), **Variables**, **Data**, **Analyses**, **Edit**, and **Settings** (the three dots $\vdots$ at the top right of the window) tabs. A toolbar appears whenever we click on a Menu tab (@tbl-menu).

## Types of Variables in Jamovi

Data variables can be one of four **measure types**:

-   ![](images/nominal.png){width="24" height="22"} **Nominal**: This type is for nominal categorical variables.

-   ![](images/ordinal.png){width="26"} **Ordinal**: This type is for ordinal categorical variables.

-   ![](images/continuous.png){width="23" height="21"} **Continuous** : this type is for variables with numeric values which are considered to be of *Interval* or *Ratio* scales.

-   ![](images/id.png){width="24"} **ID**: This will usally be our first column. This can be text or numbers, but it should be unique to each row.

Â 

and one of three **data types**:

-   **Integer**: These are full numbers e.g. 1, 2, 3, \... 100, etc. - Integers can be used for all three measure types . When used for Nominal/Ordinal data numbers will represent labels e.g. male=1; female=2.

-   **Decimal:** These are numbers with decimal points. e.g. 1.3, 5.6, 7.8, etc. - This will usually only be used for continuous data.

-   **Text:** This can be used for ordinal and nominal data.

The measure types are designated by the symbol in the header of the variable's column. Note that some combinations of data-type and measure-type don't make sense, and Jamovi won't let us choose these.

## Importing data

### The dataset

It is possible to simply begin typing values into the Jamovi spreadsheet as we would with any other spreadsheet software. Alternatively, existing data sets in a range of formats (OMV, Excel, CSV, SPSS, R data, Stata, SAS) can be opened in Jamovi. We will use the dataset named `arrhythmia.omv` as an example (@fig-arrhythmia).

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-arrhythmia
#| fig-cap: Table with raw data of arrhythmia data set.

DT::datatable(arrhythmia, extensions = 'Scroller', 
              options = list(deferRender = F, dom = 't', columnDefs = list(list(className = 'dt-center', targets = 1:6)), scrollY = 452, scroller = TRUE, scrollX = T, pageLength = 10))

```

The meta-data (data about the data) for this dataset are as following:

1.  age: age (yrs)
2.  sex: sex (0=male, 1=female)
3.  height: height (cm)
4.  weight: weight (kg)
5.  QRS: mean duration of QRS (ms) ![](images/QRS_normal.png){width="88" height="68"}
6.  heart_rate: heart rate (beats/min)

### Opening the file

To open this Jamovi file, click on the File tab ![](images/hbars.png){width="28" height="17"} at the top left hand corner (just left of the 'Variables' tab) (@fig-tab_analysis_file).

![Click on the File tab](images/tab_analysis_file.png){#fig-tab_analysis_file}

This will open the menu shown in @fig-open_file. Select 'Open' and then 'This PC', and choose tha Jamovi file 'arrhythmia' from the files listed on 'Browse' which are stored on our computer:

```{r}
#| label: fig-open_file
#| fig-align: left
#| out-width: "95%"
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: Open an existing file stored on our computer into Jamovi.

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "open_file.png"))
```

Â 

The flowchart of the process is:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A[File tab ] -.-> B(Open) -.-> C(This PC) -.-> D(Browse) -.-> E(Open \n 'arrhythmia.omv')
```

Â 

We should see data now in the Spreadsheet view (@fig-dataset).

```{r}
#| label: fig-dataset
#| fig-align: left
#| out-width: "95%"
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: The dataset 'arrhythmia'.

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "dataset.png"))
```

As we can see this is a data set with `r nrow(arrhythmia)` observations and `r ncol(arrhythmia)` variables. The categorical variable `sex` is coded as 0 for males and 1 for females, and it is stored as nominal ![](images/nominal.png){width="24" height="22"}. All other variables are continuous ![](images/continuous.png){width="23" height="21"}.

## Transforming data

### Adding labels to codes

We can add labels to numerically coded values of categorical variables. Double-click on the variable name `sex`. We will get an extra menu opened at the top of the Jamovi screen @fig-labels:

![Adding labels to numerically coded Values](images/labels.png){#fig-labels}

At this extra menu there is the **Levels** setup. We can set the labels that should appear for each level of that category. Click on the number '0' in the Levels box to enter the label for this level. Change this from a '0' to the word 'male'. Click on the number '1' and change it to 'female'.

Notice how the numbers 0 and 1 move to the lower right under the text we're typing, so we can still see which label refers to which number. Click anywhere outside the labels box to save these labels.

We close the variable settings by pressing the arrow in the top-right corner ![](images/up_arrow.png){width="25" height="25"}.

Â 

### Filtering data

Next, we select the **Filters button** ![](images/filters.png){width="25" height="23"} from the Data tab. This opens the **filter view** at the top of the Jamovi screen where we can add a filter called *Filter 1* (@fig-filter1_age). Let's say that we want to study only the adults from the participants.

![Adding a filter](images/filter1_age.png){#fig-filter1_age}

In order to access functions, press the ![](images/fx.png){width="25" height="23"} icon in the filter settings and from `VARIABLES` double-click on `age` (or we just type the variable name but if the variable has a space, we must use `'..'` around the variable name). Then type the condition `age >= 18` and press `ENTER` from the keyboard in the formula box.

::: callout-tip
## Relational (or comparison) operators in Jamovi

| **symbol** | **read as**              |
|------------|:-------------------------|
| \<         | less than                |
| \>         | greater than             |
| ==         | equal to                 |
| \<=        | less than or equal to    |
| \>=        | greater than or equal to |
| !=         | not equal to             |
:::

Notice that a column named `Filter 1` has been added to the Spreadsheet view. Cells that meet the condition `age >= 18` are checked with a green tick ![](images/tick.png){width="24" height="21"}, while the rest have a red x symbol ![](images/x.png){width="24" height="21"}. Lines with an `X` are grayed out indicating that these observations are now outside of the current dataset.

There is also a switch where we can activate ![](images/active.png){width="27" height="20"} or inactivate ![](images/inactive.png){width="27" height="20"} the filter (note that an inactivate filter will remain visible and can be toggled to active at any time).

It is also possible to hide all filter columns by clicking on the eye symbol ![](images/eye.png){width="26" height="23"} of the filters. In this case, all filters and the filtered data will remain active but will be invisible.

Finally, if we want to delete the filter permanently, click on the cross of the filter.

But we can do more complicated filters than this! Let's say that we're interested in the **adult females**. In fact we can specify this in three ways:

**a)** by using the `and` operator in 'Filter 1' which means that both conditions (adults and females) in the expression must be true at the same time. Therefore, we type the expression `age >= 18 and sex == 'female'` (@fig-filter1_age_and_sex):

```{r}
#| label: fig-filter1_age_and_sex
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "85%"
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: Combining conditions with `and` operator in one expression.

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "filter1_age_and_sex.png"))
```

Note that in the above expression we can also use double quotes around the `"female"` (i.e. `age >= 18 and sex == "female"`) or even the coded value (i.e. `age >= 18 and sex == 1`).

**b)** by adding the second condition (i.e. `sex == "female"`) as another expression to Filter 1 (by clicking the small `+` beside the first expression) (@fig-filter1_age_sex):

```{r}
#| label: fig-filter1_age_sex
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "85%"
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: Multiple expressions in the same filter.

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "filter1_age_sex.png"))
```

This additional expression comes to be represented with its own column `F1(2)` (@fig-filter1_age_sex), and by looking at the ticks and crosses, we can see which expression is responsible for excluding each row.

**c)** adding a new `Filter 2` (by selecting the large + to the left of the filters dialog box) (@fig-filter2). In this case, we can activate or inactivate the filters separately.

```{r}
#| label: fig-filter2
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "85%"
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: Multiple expressions using multiple filters.

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "filter2.png"))
```

We close the filter settings by pressing the arrow in the top-right corner ![](images/up_arrow.png){width="25" height="25"}.

::: callout-important
Filters in Jamovi exclude the rows for which the expression is not true. When filters are active, **all results** will be based on the filtered data. If we want to see unfiltered results we will either need to delete the filter or toggle it to inactive.

### Computing a new variable

Sometimes we may need to compute a new variable based on existing information (from other variables) in our data. For example, we may want to compute the body mass index (BMI), from weight (Kg) and height (m) using the formula:

$$BMI = weight/height^2$$ {#eq-bmi}

Adding computed variables to a Jamovi spreadsheet is straightforward. Click on **Add** button available on the Data tab and then select **Append** from the Computed Variable list. (Alternatevely select the Compute button ![](images/compute_button.png){width="26" height="24"}).
An empty column has been created at the end of our dataset (@fig-append). The grey dot symbol in the right of the column header indicates that this is a computed variable.

```{r}
#| label: fig-append
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "75%"
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: Adding computed variables to a Jamovi spreadsheet.

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "append.png"))
```

To set up the computed variable, either double-click on the column header, or select Setup from the Data tab. This opens the "COMPUTED VARIABLE" view where we can set the name of the computed variable as BMI and specify the @eq-bmi in the formula box (note that we must divide the height by 100) (@fig-compute_bmi):

```{r}
#| label: fig-compute_bmi
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "75%"
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: Setting up the computed variable.

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "compute_bmi.png"))
```
