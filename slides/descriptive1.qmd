## Online textbook of the course

For each lecture we provide a corresponding chapter in the online textbook of the course. For example, every student in the course has open access in the material for the Descriptive Statistics.

([Link to the Textbook](https://bougioukas-medstatsjamovi.netlify.app/descriptive.html))

## Objectives of this lecture {.scrollable}

-   To introduce descriptive statistics for categorical data
-   To present categorical data in tables and figures
-   To introduce basic summary measures for describing numerical data
-   Interpret histograms and raincloud plots

## Descriptive Statistics as a branch of Statistics

## What are Descriptive Statistics?

Descriptive statistics are used to describe and organize the basic characteristics of the data in a study.

-   They allow us to have a quick glance of the [central tendency]{style="color:#F0FFFF"} and the extent of [dispersion]{style="color:#F0FFFF"} of values.

-   They are useful in understanding a [data distribution]{style="color:#F0FFFF"} and in comparing data distributions and

-   They are usually presented in [tables]{style="color:#F0FFFF"} and [graphs]{style="color:#F0FFFF"}.

## Frequency and percentage distributions of treatment center for 202 patients with foot corns (Farndon et al. 2013).

| Treatment center | Frequency | Percentage |
|------------------|-----------|------------|
| Central          | 110       | 54.5%      |
| Manor            | 33        | 16.3%      |
| Jordanthorpe     | 24        | 11.9%      |

| **Total**        | 202       | 100.0%     |

In addition to tabulating each variable separately, we might be interested in whether the distribution of patients across each center is the same for each randomized group.

## Displaying Categorical Data {.scrollable}

While frequency tables are extremely useful, the best way to investigate a data set is to plot it.

::: panel-tabset
### Plot

![](images_slides/barplot123.png)

### Properties

-   All the bars should have equal width and should have equal space between them.

-   The height of the bar is equivalent to the data they represent.

-   The bars must be plotted against a common zero-valued baseline.
:::

 

If the sample is further classified into whether the patient was treated with corn plasters or scalpel then it becomes impossible to present the data as a single bar plot. We will present the data as a grouped barplot.

![](images_slides/grouped123.png)

## Summarizing Numerical Data

::: {.callout-tip icon="false"}
## Two summary measures should be reported for a numerical variable

-   A measure of [**location**]{style="color:#F0FFFF"} (where the center of the distribution of the values is located)
    -   Sample Mean or Average (e.g., Age: mean = 58.5 years)
    -   Median of the sample
    -   Mode of the sample
-   A measure of [**variability**]{style="color:#F0FFFF"} (how widely the values are spread above and below the central value) provides an informative but brief summary of a set of observations.
    -   Range of the sample
    -   Quartiles and Interquartile Range of the sample
    -   Sample Variance and Standard Deviation (e.g., Age: sd = 15.6 years)
:::

## Mathematical formula for the mean {.scrollable}

The sum of the observations $x_{i}$ divided by their number *n*, thus:

$$
\bar{x}= \frac{x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_{n-1} + x_n}{n}
$$

Using the ***summation symbol*** $\scriptstyle\sum$ to shorten it:

$$\bar{x}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}}{n}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}$$ The Greek letter ${\Sigma}$ (sigma) stands for 'sum' and simply means 'add up the *n* observations $x_{i}$ from the 1st to the last (nth)'.

 

::: {.callout-tip icon="false"}
## Advantages and Disadvantages of arithmetic mean

[**Advantages**]{style="color:#F0FFFF"}

1.  is simple to understand and easy to calculate
2.  uses all the data values in the calculation
3.  is algebraically defined and thus mathematically manageable
4.  has a known sampling distribution

[**Disadvantages**]{style="color:#F0FFFF"}

1.  is highly affected by the presence of a few abnormally high or abnormally low values (outliers)
2.  is not an appropriate average for highly skewed (asymmetrical) distributions
3.  cannot be determined if any item of observation is missing
4.  cannot be determined easily by inspection of the data
:::

## Displaying Numerical Data {.scrollable}

The best way for examining the distribution of numerical data (e.g., age) is to generate an appropriate graph.

<br>

[**A. Histogram**]{style="color:#F0FFFF"}

A histogram gives information about the most common way of depicting a frequency distribution of a continuous variable.

-   The amount of variability in the data.

-   Where the peaks of the distribution are.

::: panel-tabset
### Plot

![](images_slides/histo123.png)

### Properties

-   It depicts the distribution of a numeric variable's values as a series of bars without space between them.

-   Each bar typically covers a range of numeric values called a bin or class

-   A bar's height indicates the frequency of observations with a value within the corresponding bin.
:::

<br>

[**B. Raincloud Plot**]{style="color:#F0FFFF"}

-   A modern, but more informative, alternative of a boxplot.

-   Combines raw data (dots), histogram, and key summary statistics such as median, and relevant intervals.
