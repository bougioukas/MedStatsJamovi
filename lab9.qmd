When we have finished this Lab, we should be able to:

## Learning objectives

-   Understand the concept of correlation of two numeric variables.
-   Compute Pearson’s r (or Spearmans $r_{s}$) correlation coefficient between two numeric variables
-   Discuss the possible meaning of correlation that we observe.

In this Lab, we will use the data from `LungCapacity` dataset.(**Note:** This starts by assuming we know how to get data into Jamovi).



### Opening the file

Open the dataset named `LungCapacity` from the file tab in the menu:

![The LungCapacity dataset](images/lungcap.png){#fig-lungcap1}

The dataset `LungCapacity` has 725 participants and includes three variables. The numeric variables of interest are the `Age` and the `LungCap` (@fig-lungcap1). Double-click on the variable name `Age` and change the measure type from nominal ![](images/nominal.png){width="23" height="21"} to continuous ![](images/continuous.png){width="23" height="21"}.


### Research question

Let’s say that we want to explore the association between age (in years) and lung capacity (in liters) for the sample of 725 participants in a survey.


### Hypothesis Testsing

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis

-   $H_{0}:$ there is not association between `Age` and `LungCap` ($ρ = 0$).

-   $H_{1}:$ there is association between `Age` and `LungCap` ($ρ \neq 0$).

### Graphical display with a scatter plot

A first step that is usually useful in studying the association between two continuous variables is to prepare a **scatter plot** of the data.
The pattern made by the points plotted on the scatter plot usually suggests the basic nature and strength of the association between two variables.

The flowchart of the process is:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A(Analyses tab) -.-> B(Exploration) -.-> C(Scatter plot)
```

from the top menu, as shown below in @fig-lungcap_scatter1.

![In the Analyses Tab select Exploration and click on Scatterplot](images/lungcap_scatter1.png){#fig-lungcap_scatter1}


The `Scatterplot` dialogue box opens, as shown below @fig-lungcap_scatter2:

![The Scatterplot dialogue box](images/lungcap_scatter2.png){#fig-lungcap_scatter2 width="450" height="442"}

Transfer the `Age` and `LungCap` variables from the box on the left side of the screen into the `X-Axis` and `Y-Axis` boxes on the right side by highlighting the variables and pressing the Arrow Button (![](images/right_arrow.png){width="23" height="21"})  (alternatively, drag and drop the variables), respectively. Finally, from `Marginals` click on the `Densities` radio button. We will end up with the following screen:

![Transfer the `Age` variable into the `X-Axis` box and the `LungCap` variable into the `Y-Axis` box ](images/lungcap_scatter3.png){#fig-lungcap_scatter3 width="500" height="442"}

The output should look like the following graph (@fig-lungcap_scatter4):

![The Scatter of Age and Lung Capacity with the marginal density plots](images/lungcap_scatter4.png){#fig-lungcap_scatter4 width="600"}

The above density plots (light blue histograms) show that the data are approximately **normally distributed** for both `Age` and `LungCap` (we have a large sample so the graphs are reliable).

Additionally, the points in the scatter plot seem to be scattered around an invisible **line**. The scatter plot also shows that, in general, older participants tend to have higher lung capacity (**positive association**).

The Pearson’s correlation coefficient can quantify the strength of this linear association (alternative is Spearman's correlation coefficients).

 

### Applying the Pearson’s correlation coefficient, r

Running correlation in Jamovi requires only a few steps once the data is ready to go. To start, click on the `Regression` and then on `Correlation Matrix`: 

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A(Analyses tab) -.-> B(Regression) -.-> C(Correlation Matrix)
```

from the top menu, as shown below in @fig-lungcap_scatter5.

![In the Analyses Tab select Regression and click on Correlation Matrix](images/lungcap_scatter5.png){#fig-lungcap_scatter5}

The `Correlation Matrix` dialogue box opens, as shown below @fig-lungcap_scatter6:

![The Correlation Matrix dialogue box](images/lungcap_scatter6.png){#fig-lungcap_scatter6 width="500" height="530"}


Transfer the `Age` and `LungCap` variables from the box on the left-hand side of the screen into the box on the right-hand side by highlighting the variables and pressing the Arrow Button (![](images/right_arrow.png){width="23" height="21"})  (alternatively, drag and drop the variables), respectively. 


In the `Correlation Coefficients` section we can select between the following three: Pearson's, Spearman, or Kendall's coefficient. We keep the default choice of Pearson.
Finally, from `Additional Options` check the `Confidence Intervals` box. We will end up with the following screen:

![Transfer the `Age` and `LungCap` variables from the left-hand side to the right-hand side box and  check the  `Confidence Intervals` box](images/lungcap_scatter7.png){#fig-lungcap_scatter7 width="480" height="530"}

The output table should look like the following (@fig-lungcap_cortable):

![The output table of correlation coefficient ](images/lungcap_cortable.png){#fig-lungcap_cortable width="350" height="280"}

## Interpretation of the results

There is evidence of a significant **linear positive very strong** association between **Age** and **Lung Capacity** (r= 0.82, 95% CI: 0.79 to 0.84, p \< 0.001).
