## Installing distrACTION module in Jamovi

Some useful analyses are not pre-installed in Jamovi, but we can access them very easily by installing **modules**. This is one of the very useful features of Jamovi. While other programs are very difficult to modify after you install them, it is very easy to add new analyses to Jamovi. 

To install a new module, we want to click on the button in the upper-right corner labeled “Modules” ![](images/modules.png){width="44"}. Then click on “Jamovi library” (@fig-jam_lib). This will show us the modules that Jamovi has preloaded.

![“Jamovi library” includes the modules that the program has preloaded](images/jam_lib.png){#fig-jam_lib}

 

From here, we can see the pre-loaded modules that are available for installation. To install one, we need to scroll down until we find it. We are going to install the module, **“distrACTION”**. Once we find it, we click on the **“INSTALL”** button under it (@fig-distrAction).

![By clicking on the **“Install”** button we can download modules](images/distrAction.png){#fig-distrAction}


If successful, the “INSTALL” button should now read, “INSTALLED”. To see if our module was successfully installed, we need to go back to the main screen. To do so, click on the “up” arrow ![](images/up_arrow){width="25"} in the upper-right corner of the library that hides the Jamovi library.

Now we can see the module called **“distrACTION”** ![](images/distrAction2){width="50"} on our `Analyses` tab at the top. If we can see it, then we successfully installed our module.



The **“distrACTION”** module has two discrete distributions (Binomial and Poisson) and four continuous (normal distribution, T-distribution, chi-squared and F-distribution)  to show what happens to the cumulative density function and the quartile density function when you modify parameters. 



## Binomial distribution: Example-breast cancer

Suppose that we recruited a group of **50 patients** with breast cancer and we study their survival within five years from diagnosis. Additionally, assume that all patients have the same  five-year survival probability, **p = 0.8**, and the survival status of one patient **does not** affect the probability of survival for another patient. Let's answer the following two questions:

**A.** What is the probability of 40 survivals (out of 50) in five years from diagnosis?

Navigate to:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A(Analyses) -.-> B(distrACTION) -.-> C(Binomial Distribution)
```

as shown below (@fig-binomial1):

![Selection of the Binomial Distribution from the distrACTION](images/binomial1.png){#fig-binomial1}


Now, define the parameters `Size = 50` and `Probability = 0.8`. Then check the `Compute probability` box, select $P(X = x1)$ (the default) and set `x1 = 40`, as shown below (@fig-binomial2):

![Define the parameters of the binomial distribution and compute the probability for x1=40](images/binomial2.png){#fig-binomial2}

A small table and the probability distribution will appear in the output window, as shown below  (@fig-binomial3):

![The binomial distribution X ∼ Binomial(50, 0.8), P(X=40)= 0.14](images/binomial3.png){#fig-binomial3}


Τhe probability of 40 survivals is P(X= 40) = 0.14.

 

**B.** What is the probability that either 34 or 35 or 36 patients survive for five years from diagnosis?

To answer this question select $P(x1≤ X ≤x2)$ and set `x1 = 34` and `x2 = 36`, as shown below (@fig-binomial4):

![Define the parameters of the binomial distribution and compute the probability for x1=34 and x2=36](images/binomial4.png){#fig-binomial4}


The results will appear in the output window, as shown below  (@fig-binomial5):

![The binomial distribution X ∼ Binomial(50, 0.8), P(34≤ X ≤36)= 0.1](images/binomial5.png){#fig-binomial5}


Since the underlying event include three possible outcomes, 34, 35, and 36, we obtain the probability by adding the individual probabilities for these outcomes:

$$P(34≤ X ≤36) = P(X = 34) + P(X = 35) + P(X = 36) = 0.02 + 0.03 + 0.05 = 0.1$$
 

## Poisson distribution: Example-physician visits per year

Assume that the rate of physician visits per year is λ = 2.5.


**A.** What is the probability of one visit per year?

Navigate to:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A(Analyses) -.-> B(distrACTION) -.-> C(Poisson Distribution)
```

as shown below (@fig-poisson1):

![Selection of the Poisson Distribution from the distrACTION](images/poisson1.png){#fig-poisson1}

Now, define the parameter `λ= 2.5`. Then check the `Compute probability` box, select $P(X = x1)$ (the default) and set `x1 = 1`, as shown below (@fig-poisson2):

![Define the parameters of the binomial distribution and compute the probability for x1=1](images/poisson2.png){#fig-poisson2}

The results will appear in the output window, as shown below  (@fig-poisson3):


![The poisson distribution X ∼ Poisson(2.5), P(X = 1) = 0.21 ](images/poisson3.png){#fig-poisson3}

The probability of one visit per year is P(X = 1) = 0.21.

 

**B.** What is the probability of up to three visits per year?

To answer this question select $P(X ≤x1)$ and set `x1 = 3` , as shown below (@fig-poisson4):

![Define the parameters of the binomial distribution and compute the probability for X ≤ 3](images/poisson4.png){#fig-poisson4}


The results will appear in the output window, as shown below  (@fig-poisson5):

![The poisson distribution X ∼ Poisson(2.5), P(X ≤ 3)= 0.76 ](images/poisson5.png){#fig-poisson5}

This is the probability that a person visit her/his physician 0, or 1, or 2, or 3 times within one year. As before, we add the individual probabilities for the corresponding outcomes: P(X ≤ 3) = 0.08 + 0.21 + 0.26 + 0.21 = 0.76.




## Normal distribution: Example-systolic blood pressure

Suppose we know that the population mean and standard deviation for systolic blood pressure (sbp) are μ = 125 mmHg and σ = 15 mmHg, respectively.


**A.** About what percentage of population has sbp in the range μ±σ ?

Navigate to:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A(Analyses) -.-> B(distrACTION) -.-> C(Normal Distribution)
```

as shown below (@fig-normal1):

![Selection of the Normal Distribution from the distrACTION](images/normal1.png){#fig-normal1}


Now, define the parameters `Mean = 125` and `SD = 15`. Then check the `Compute probability` box, select $P(x1≤ X ≤x2)$ and set `x1 = 110` (125-15) and `x2 = 140` (125 + 15), as shown below (@fig-normal2):


![Define the parameters of the normal distribution and compute the probability for 110≤X≤ 140](images/normal2.png){#fig-normal2}

The results will appear in the output window, as shown below  (@fig-normal3):

![The normal distribution X ∼ N(125, $15^2$), P(110≤X≤ 140)= 0.68 ](images/normal3.png){#fig-normal3}


Thus, the percentage of the distribution between -1 $\sigma$ below the mean and +1 $\sigma$ above the mean is:

$$ P(125 −15≤X≤ 125+15) = P(110≤X≤ 140) = 0.68\ or\ 68\% $$
 

**B.** Calculate a 95% reference range for the sbp.


To answer this question check the `Compute quantiles` box, select `Central interval quartiles`, and set `p= 0.95`, as shown below (@fig-normal4):

![Define the parameters of the normal distribution and set p=0.95 and click on `central interval quantiles`](images/normal4.png){#fig-normal4}

The results will appear in the output window, as shown below  (@fig-normal5):

![The normal distribution X ∼ N(125, $15^2$), 95% ref. range = (95.6, 154.4)](images/normal5.png){#fig-normal5}


$$ 95\% \ ref. \ range \equiv (125 - 1.96\times 15,\ 125 + 1.96\times 15) = (95.6, 154.4) $$

 

## Standard Normal distribution: Example-calculate the area under the curve

Calculate the area between $z_1$=1 and $z_2$=2 of a Standard Normal distribution.

Check the `Compute probability` box, select $P(x1≤ X ≤x2)$ and set `x1 = 1`  and `x2 = 2`, as shown below (@fig-normal6):


![Define the parameters of the standard normal distribution and set x1=1 and x2=2](images/normal6.png){#fig-normal6}


The results will appear in the output window, as shown below  (@fig-normal7):

![The standard normal distribution X ∼ Z(0, $1^2$), P(1≤X≤2) ](images/normal7.png){#fig-normal7}

We can also easily calculate the area using the properties of the (standard) normal distribution:

$E = P(0\leq Z\leq 2) - P(0\leq Z\leq 1) \approx 0.48 - 0.34 \approx 0.14$
