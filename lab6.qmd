## Learning objectives

-   Applying hypothesis testing
-   Compare two independent samples
-   Compare paired (related) samples
-   Interpret the results
:::

## Two-sample t-test (Student's t-test)

Two sample t-test (Student's t-test) can be used if we have two independent (unrelated) groups (e.g., males-females, treatment-non treatment) and one quantitative variable of interest.

### Opening the file

Open the dataset named `depression` from the file tab in the menu:

![The depression dataset](images/depression1.png){#fig-depression1}

The dataset `depression` has 76 patients and includes two variables. The `treatment` variable and the `HDRS` variable (@fig-depression1). Double-click on the variable name `HDRS` and change the measure type from nominal ![](images/nominal.png){width="23" height="21"} to continuous ![](images/continuous.png){width="23" height="21"}.

### Research question

In an experiment designed to test the effectiveness of paroxetine for treating bipolar depression, the participants were randomly assigned into two groups (intervention Vs placebo).

The researchers used the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) to measure the depression state of the participants and wanted to find out if the HDRS score is different in paroxetine group as compared to placebo group at the end of the experiment. The significance level α was set to 0.05.

Note A score of 0--7 in HDRS is generally accepted to be within the normal range, while a score of 20 or higher indicates at least moderate severity.

### Hypothesis Testsing for the Student's t-test

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis

-   $H_0$: the means of HDRS in the two groups are equal ($\mu_{1} = \mu_{2}$)
-   $H_1$: the means of HDRS in the two groups are not equal ($\mu_{1} \neq \mu_{2}$)
:::

### Assumptions

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Assumptions of the Student's t-test

1.  The data are **normally** distributed in both groups
2.  The data in both groups have similar **variance** (also named as homogeneity of variance or homoscedasticity)
:::

**A. Explore the descriptive characteristics of distribution for each group and check for normality**

The distributions can be explored visually with appropriate plots. Additionally, summary statistics and significance tests to check for normality (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk test) and for equality of variances (e.g., Levene's test) can be used.

We select:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A(Analyses) -.-> B(Exploration) -.-> C(Descriptives)
```

Drag the variable `HDRS` into the `Variables` box and split it by the `treatment` variable, as shown below (@fig-descriptives12):

![Split the variable HDRS by treatment group](images/descriptives12.png){#fig-descriptives12 width=75%}

We can now select the relevant descriptive statistics such as `Percantiles`, `Skewness`, `Kurtosis` and the `Shapiro-Wilk` test from the `Statistics` section:

![In the Statistics section select the descriptive statistics of interest.](images/descriptives13.png){#fig-descriptives13 width=75%}

Once we have selected our descriptive statistics, a table will appear in the output window on our right-hand side, as shown below:

![Descriptive statistics of HDSR by treatment group](images/descriptives14.png){#fig-descriptives14}

The means are close to medians (20.3 vs 21 and 21.5 vs 21). The skewness is approximately zero (symmetric distribution) and the (excess) kurtosis is close to zero (mesokurtic distribution) indicating normal distributions for both groups.

Additionally, the Shapiro-Wilk tests of normality suggest that the data for the `HDRS` in both groups, paroxetine and placebo, are normally distributed (p=0.67 >0.05 and p=0.61 >0.05, respectively). (NOTE: If the $p \geq 0.05$, then the data came from a normally distributed population).



::: {.callout-important}
# Remember: Hypothesis testing for Shapiro-Wilk test for normality

$H_{0}$: the data came from a normally distributed population.

$H_{1}$: the data tested are not normally distributed.

-   If p − value \< 0.05, reject the null hypothesis, $H_{0}$.
-   If p − value ≥ 0.05, do not reject the null hypothesis, $H_{0}$.

:::


Then we can check the `Density` from `Histograms` in the `Plot` section, as shown below (@fig-descriptives15):

![In the Plot section select Density from Histograms.](images/plots_density.png){#fig-plots_density width=75%}

A graph is generated in the output window on our right-hand side, as shown below:

![In the Plots section select Density from Histograms.](images/descriptives15.png){#fig-descriptives15 width=75%}

The above figure shows that the data are close to symmetry and the assumption of a normal distribution is reasonable.


**B. Homogeneity of variance**

The second assumption that should be satisfied is the homogeneity of variance. We observe in the summary table of @fig-descriptives14 that the two standard deviations (3.65 vs 3.41) are similar (see also below the Levene’s test for equality of variances in @fig-t_test4).

 

### Run the Student’s t-test 

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
# Perform a Student’s t-test 

We will perform a Student’s t-test to test the null hypothesis that the mean HDRS score is the same for both groups (paroxetine and placebo).

We select:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A(Analyses) -.-> B(T-Tests) -.-> C(Independent Samples T-Test)
```

![In the Plots section select Density from Histograms.](images/t_test1.png){#fig-t_test1 width=75%}

The `Independent Samples T-Test` dialogue box opens. Drag and drop the numeric variable `HSDR` to Dependent Variables and the independent variable `treatment` to Grouping Variable, as shown below @fig-t_test2:

![The Independent Samples T-Test dialogue box](images/t_test2.png){#fig-t_test2 width=75%}


We observe that we can select between the following three Tests: Students's, Welch's, or Mann-Whitney U. We keep the default choice of Students's test. Finally, from `Additional Statistics` check the `Mean difference`, `Confidence Intervals`, `Descriptive`, and `Descriptive plots` boxes. Finally, from `Assumption Checks` tick the `Homogeneity test`. We will end up with the following screen:

![Additional statistics and tests.](images/t_test3.png){#fig-t_test3 width=75%}

First, we look at the table of `Levene's test` for equality of variances (@fig-t_test4):

![Levene's test.](images/t_test4.png){#fig-t_test4 width=60%}

Since the p = 0.646 ≥ 0.05, the $H_0$ of the Levene's test is not rejected. (NOTE: If the $p \geq 0.05$, then the population variances of HDRs in two groups are equal).


::: {.callout-important}
# Remember: Hypothesis testing for Levene’s test for equality of variances

$H_{0}$: the variances of HDRs in two groups are equal

$H_{1}$: the variances of HDRs in two groups are not equal

-   If p − value \< 0.05, reject the null hypothesis, $H_{0}$.
-   If p − value ≥ 0.05, do not reject the null hypothesis, $H_{0}$.

:::

If the assumption of equal variances is not satisfied (Levene's test gives p \< 0.05, reject $H_0$), the Welch's t-test should be used from the available Tests in Jamovi (@fig-t_test3).



Next, we can inspect again the results in the group descriptives (@fig-t_test5) and plots (@fig-t_test6):


![Group descriptives.](images/t_test5.png){#fig-t_test5 width=75%}

![Plot of mean and median of HDRS by treatment.](images/t_test6.png){#fig-t_test6 width=75%}


Finally, we present the results of the Student's t-test in the table of the @fig-t_test7:

![The results of the t-test.](images/t_test7.png){#fig-t_test7 width=75%}

The p-value = 0.16 is greater than 0.05. There is no evidence of a significant difference in mean HDRS between the two groups (failed to reject Ho). The difference between means (20.33 - 21.49) equals to -1.16  units of the HDRS and note that the 95% confidence interval of the difference in means (-2.78 to 0.47) **includes** the hypothesized null value of 0. Based on these results, there is not evidence that paroxetine is effective as a treatment for bipolar depression.  

Note that the paroxetine sample (n= 33) has 32 (33-1) degrees of freedom and the placebo sample (n= 43) has 42 (43-1), so we have 74 (32 + 42) df in total. Another way of thinking of this is that the complete sample size is 76, and we have estimated two parameters from the data (the two means), so we have 76-2 = 74 df.

The Student t-test for two independent samples does not have any restrictions on $n_1$ and $n_2$ —**they can be equal or unequal**. However, equal samples are preferred because when a total of 2n subjects are available, their equal division among the groups maximizes the power to detect a specified difference.

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
## Mann-Whitney U test

When there is violation of normality, the Mann-Whitney U test can be selected from the available Tests in Jamovi (@fig-t_test4). This test compares two independent samples based on the ranks of the values and is often considered the non-parametric equivalent to the Student's t-test.
