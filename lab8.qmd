## Learning objectives

-   Applying hypothesis testing for chi-square test of independence
-   Investigate the association between two categorical variables
-   Interpret the results

## Introduction

If we want to look at the association between two categorical variables then we can’t use the mean or any similar statistic because we don’t have any variables that have been measured continuously. Therefore, when we have measured categorical variables, we analyze frequencies. That is, we analyze the number of subjects that fall into each combination of categories. We can tabulate these frequencies and this is known as a cross-tabulation table or a two-way table or a **contingency table**.



## Chi-square test of independence

If we want to see whether there’s an association between two categorical variables we can use the chi-square test, often called chi-square test of independence. This is an extremely elegant statistic based on the simple idea of comparing the frequencies we observe in certain categories to the frequencies we might expect to get in those categories by chance. 


### Opening the file

We will use the “Survival from Malignant Melanoma” dataset named "meldata". The data consist of measurements made on patients with malignant melanoma, a type of skin cancer. Each patient had their tumor removed by surgery at the Department of Plastic Surgery, University Hospital of Odense, Denmark, between 1962 and 1977.


Open the dataset named `meldata` from the file tab in the menu:

![The meldata dataset](images/chi_data.png){#fig-chi_data width="85%"}

The dataset `meldata` includes 205 patients and has seven variables. We are intrested in association between the binary variables `ulcer` (Absent/Present) and `satus` (Alive/Died)(@fig-chi_data).


### Research question

We are interested in the association between tumor ulceration and death from melanoma.


### Hypothesis Testsing for the Pearson’s Chi-square test of independence

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis

-   $H_0$: There is no association between the two categorical variables (they are independent). In other words, there is no difference in the proportion of patients with ulcerated tumors who die compared with non-ulcerated tumors ($p_{ulcerated} = p_{non-ulcertaed}$).
-   $H_1$: There is association between the two categorical variables (they are dependent). In other words, there is difference in the proportion of patients with ulcerated tumors who die compared with non-ulcerated tumors ($p_{ulcerated} \neq p_{non-ulcertaed}$).

### Assumption

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Check if the following assumption is satisfied

**For 2x2 tables:** All **expected counts should be ≥ 5 in each cell** of the 2x2 table. 


**For larger tables:** All expected counts should be > 1 and no more than 20\% of all cells should have expected counts < 5.

### Explore the data with plots and tables

We select:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A(Analyses) -.-> B(Frequencies) -.-> C(Contingency Tables \nIndependent Samples \nx<sup>2 </sup> test of association)
```

from the top menu, as shown below in @fig-chi0.

![In the Analyses Tab select Frequencies and click on the x<sup>2 </sup> test of association.](images/chi0.png){#fig-chi0 width="75%"}

The `Contingency Tables` dialogue box opens. Drag the variable `ulcer` into the `Rows` box and the variable `status` into the `Columns` box, as shown below (@fig-chi1):

![Drag the variable `ulcer` into the `Rows` and the variable `status` into the `Columns`.](images/chi1.png){#fig-chi1 width="75%"}



**A. Stacked bar plot**

First, it is useful to plot the data as counts. In the `Plot` section, check the `Bar Plot` and `Stacked` bar type, as shown below (@fig-chi2):

![Stacked bar plot with counts (absolute frequencies).](images/chi2.png){#fig-chi2 width="70%"}

A bar plot is generated in the output on our right-hand side, as shown below (@fig-chi3):

![Stacked bar plot with counts (absolute frequencies).](images/chi3.png){#fig-chi3 width="65%"}


In practice, it is percentages we are comparing. Let's create a stacked bar plot with percentages. In the `Plot` section, now, check the `Percentages` and `within rows`, as shown below (@fig-chi4):

![Select the Y-axis to present within row percentages.](images/chi4.png){#fig-chi4 width="65%"}


![Stacked bar plot with row percentages.](images/chi5.png){#fig-chi5 width="65%"}


Just from the plot in @fig-chi5, death from melanoma in the ulcerated tumor (Present) group is around 45% and in the non-ulcerated (Absent) group around 15%. The number of patients included in the study is not huge, however, this still looks like a real difference given its effect size.


**B. Contingency Table**

We will create a contingency `2x2` table with row percentages and the expected counts for the binary variables `ulcer` (Absent/Present) and `satus` (Alive/Died). In the `Cells` section, check the `Row` and `Expected counts` boxes, as shown below (@fig-chi6):

![Select row percentages and expected counts.](images/chi6.png){#fig-chi6 width="65%"}

We present the generated contingency table in @fig-chi7:


![Contingency table of ulcer and status.](images/chi7.png){#fig-chi7 width="65%"}

From the raw frequencies, there seems to be a large difference, as we noted in @fig-chi5. The proportion of patients with ulcerated tumors who die equals to 46% compared with non-ulcerated tumors 14%.

Additionally, as we observe in @fig-chi7 the assumption of chi-square test is fulfilled (all the expected counts are greater than 5; green cells).

## Chi-square test

Finally, we see the results of the chi-square test. 

![Table with the results of chi-square test.](images/chi8.png){#fig-chi8 width="45%"}

Since p<0.001, there is evidence for an association between the ulcer and status (reject $H_0$).
:::


**Interpretation**

There is evidence for an association between the ulcer and status (reject $H_0$). The proportion of patients with ulcerated tumors who died (46\%) is significant larger compared with non-ulcerated tumors (14\%) (p-value <0.001).


::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
## Odds ratio
Let's calculate the odds ratio of the 2x2 table in @fig-chi7 by hand:

$$ Odds \ Ratio = \frac{\frac{41}{49}}{\frac{16}{99}} =\frac{0.837}{0.162} = 5.17$$
We can also find the odds ratio with the 95\% CI using Jamovi.

In the `Statistics` section, check the `Odds ratio` and `Condidence intervals` boxes, as shown below (@fig-odds1):


![Calculate the odds ratio and 95% condidence intervals.](images/odds1.png){#fig-odds1 width="65%"}

The output is following (@fig-odds2):

![The odds ratio and 95% condidence interval of the 2x2 table.](images/odds2.png){#fig-odds2 width="50%"}

The odds of dying is 5.18 (95\% CI: 2.65, 10.13) times higher for patients with ulcerated tumors compared to non-ulcerated tumors patients. Note that the 95% confidence interval of the OR **does not include** the hypothesized null value of 1.
